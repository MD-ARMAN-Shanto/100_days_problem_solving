1. Floyd's algorithm about tortoise and hare

**Phase 1**
2. taking tortoise and hare with an intial value from the list
3. loop until tortoise == hare
4. while looping traverse the list for tortoise and hare
5. while tortoise moving around the list with an speed of x besides hare moving on the list of 2x speed
6. so at some point tortoise meet with hare and we then break from the loop

**Phase 2**
giving tortoise another chance to catch the tortoise
1. initialize the tortoise with initial value
2. while tortoise value and hare value not equal moving around the list once again
3. now this time we will move around the list with x speed for both tortoise and hare
4. and it is sure that at some point tortoise meet with hare with a duplicate value match

then we finally return the hare or tortoise
